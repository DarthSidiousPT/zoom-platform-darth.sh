# doZennn/innoextract (the ZOOM-patched fork this script depends on for --zoom-game-id
# and --print-headers) hasn't cut a GitHub Release since v1.11.1 (2024-03-03), which only
# understands Inno Setup installers up to 6.2.2. Real ZOOM Platform installers already
# ship with newer Inno Setup versions (e.g. e-Racer's is 6.6.0), so that release binary
# fails --zoom-game-id on them and the script wrongly reports "doesn't seem to be a ZOOM
# Platform installer". We maintain our own fork (DarthSidiousPT/innoextract) with its own
# release pipeline (tags v<version>, e.g. v1.13-darth) so we control when fixes
# land instead of waiting on upstream's release cadence. Pin a specific release tag here;
# bump INNOEXTRACT_TAG after verifying a newer release against real installers.
